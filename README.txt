## Project description 
In this project you can create a user, login, create posts and topics, and delete your posts and topics. 

## Admin password
There is only one admin user

## Structure 
First the user is directed to the index.php file where they can see all the available topics and entries. 
When not logged in the user can only see these topics and entries, but not create. 
The user can register or login if they have a user already created. 
When logged in the user can create both topics and entries, and delete their own entries and topics (topics can only
be deleted once there is no entries inside it). The user can also see what type
they are when logged in (author or admin). 
The admin can delete anything.
